My senior spring I took a State Estimation course. The focus was probabalistic robotics, relying heavily on Sebastian Thrun et al's book of the same name. We covered probability distributions as state representations, Baye's Filter, the Kalman Filter(s) and Particle Filters before moving onto a brief treatment of mapping and SLAM. 

One of my favorite labs was my first implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which I am very proud of. For me, it had been something I had wanted to do for a while so it was very satisfying. It was back at my internship with Doosan Bobcat that I had realized the importance of state estimation. At that point I had taken some robotics and control courses but still did not understand the value of dedicated observers. Only once in the field working with noisy radar data did I realize the problems posed by noisey measurments and the huge need for a filter to extract a reasonable estimate of the true state.

For this lab, we were using data recorded by a LiDAR and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from an experiment where a bot navigated a 10x10 meter square path located in the center of an open field. At the center of the square was a pylon â€“ the
only object discernable by the lidar data. This pylon served as the landmark at known location (5.0, -5.0) in the global coordinate frame with which the EKF localization was conducted. The prediction step consisted of integrating the accelerometer data to obtain a position and using the compass measurment as an orientation. The correction step would fuse the LiDAR data with this. Since there is only a single known landmark, it is simple to extract the location of the robot through coordinate transforms.

My partner and I successfully integrated the filter in Python. You can see a plot of the estimated path below.

We evaluated the filter using the Root Mean Square Path tracking error. This was found to be 0.2 m. 
We performed the same localization with a particle filter as well. You can see the same estimated path below. This was generated using 1000 particles with an unknown starting point.

The resulting RMSE was 0.2041 m.

Our detailed reports are available for the [EKF](https://github.com/peterjohnsonhmc/E205/blob/master/Lab3/E205_Lab3.pdf) and the [particle filter](https://github.com/peterjohnsonhmc/E205/blob/master/Lab4/E205_Lab4.pdf).
