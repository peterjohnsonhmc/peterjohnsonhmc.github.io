Hi there, I'm Peter. I just graduated from Harvey Mudd College, receiving my Bachelor's of Science with Distinction
in Engineering. My focus is in robotics, controls, and embedded systems. I am particularly interested in state estimation and control for autonomous navigation. I am currently looking for a full time position or an internship. I plan on pursuing a masters degree in the area of robotics, but would like to get some industry experience first. Click through my blog to see some of my favorite projects. 

I grew up participating in Boy Scouts and enjoy backpacking. I have also developed an interest in historical gardens from I class I took at Scripps College. Growing up in Hawaii has given me an appreciation for Aloha shirts which I collect by thrifting. I'll also try to post about these as well.
