Hi there, I'm Peter. I just graduated from Harvey Mudd College, receiving my Bachelor's of Science with Distinction
in Engineering. My focus is in robotics, controls, and embedded systems. My background is strongest in state estimation and control for autonomous systems. However, I am also interested in perception, object tracking and planning. I am currently looking for a full time position or an internship. I plan on pursuing a masters degree in the area of robotics, but would like to get some industry experience first. Click through my blog to see some of my favorite projects. 


My other interests which may also make their way into blog posts include backpacking, Aloha shirts, historical gardens, and weightlifting.
